What are the goals?

Citizen quality of life / fitness { Aggregated agent fitness functions }
Maximise resource store { Resource stores - absolute count }
Resilience { Resource consumption rate vs resource stores }
Dominance {  }
Strength - offensive power { Number and quality of soldiers - offense scores }
Strength - defensive power { NUmber and quality of soldiers - defence scores }
Social links / cohesion { Social net scoring - aggregated agent between-ness for whole clan }
Social influence { External link scoring, positive / regularity of interaction with other clans - positive }
Global Influence { Total area of influence - harvestors, agents, soldiers - spatial measure }
Environment Knowledge { Star system knowledge store vs num planets / stars }
Technology / tech level { Absolute tech level / ranking }
Battles won / lost { Number of times agent won / lost }
Collection Rate - energy, raw mats { Absolute collection rate }
Fabrication rate { Absolute fabrication rate }
Trade Health - { Amount of fulfilled contracts vs waiting contracts }
Economic Health { Spend vs save, amount of resources in area of influence }
Diplomatic Health { Standing with other clans aggregated }


These need to be combined into a single score that can be compared between clans
All clans just aim to maximise their ranking across all of the above - its for them to figure out the strategy.
The closer they are to top rank in all of the above the higher the reward.
e.g.:
[1,2,1] = 3/4 = 0.75
[2,1,2] = 3/5 = 0.6
[3,3,3] = 3/9 = 0.33

This can also then drive the modelling, as the feature vector will be measures of the above.
For the features though we dont want to encode the rankings - better to encode the absolute scorings
